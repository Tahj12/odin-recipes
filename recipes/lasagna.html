        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This no-bake skillet lasagna is made right on your stovetop and is a fast and easy alternative to store-bought hamburger mixes!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 Jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 Can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 Onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 Clove garlic</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons dried basil</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 Cups dried malfalda noodles</li>
            <li>1 Cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
